## Code and Execution
All analysis and data cleaning were conducted in R. The key scripts in the `R` folder are:
- **Job_Posting.R**: This script contains the full code for data cleaning and preprocessing, resulting in the creation of the `postings_cleaned` dataset used for analysis.
- **Markdown_job_postings.Rmd**: This R Markdown file documents the data analysis and visualization steps.

To view the processed data and visualizations directly, refer to the `report.md` file, or to run the full code, open the relevant scripts in RStudio.
